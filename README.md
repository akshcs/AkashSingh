Notes/Assumptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I was not very clear on the requirement for adding tests, to be on a safetr side I have added all the unit and intergration tests. Since, the service is also deplyed it should be reasonanbly less time consuming to test and review for reviewers.
- I have assumed that persisting any information was not part of this excercise and thus I have not used any DB to store any informastion. I can add a persistent layer and a DB if it is required as a part of the excercise
